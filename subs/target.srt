00:00:01,715 --> 00:00:02,965
- Hehe.
We're here!

4
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:09,275
I made a mistake and I started it vertically.
We're back after all that.

Hi, WIZ*ONE!

Chaewon - What is it?
Minju. - Here you go.

12
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:32,445
Can you write it for me?

13

Yujin - I tried it on!
CHAE WON - Is that right?
Minju. I like it.
Tommy. - Cute.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,920
You can't see it again if your ears fall backwards (?

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,520
MIN JU - Oh, you look so pretty right now. (Kang)
Eugene. - Okay.

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,260
Please read the comments.

25

Minju. - Yeah, you two look like real twins.
Eugene - Uh, it's dark all of a sudden.

27
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,160
Minju - (Agreed) It's suddenly dark.
Tommy. - Oh, maybe it's because I'm in front of you.
Yujin - I guess it's because we're close!

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,336
Eunbi - Oh, it's too far(?)
Tommy - Closer

29
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:18,120
Minju - Is this a focus?
Tommy. Oh.
Eugene - (agree) Yes.

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,780
Eunbi - It's a matter of focus.
Do you want me to move the camera a little bit more sideways?

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,600
It gets dark when we get closer.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,485
Oh! The person in front of you looks bright and the person behind you looks black.

33
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,540
Tommy. - Uh, isn't that okay?
Eugene. - I'm just fine right now.

34
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,505
Minju, we need to bend down.

35

Yesterday.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,140
Oh, we're going to perform at the Seoul Music Awards.

39
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,780
I thought I had long bangs, but they split a lot.

40
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,960
And so, I was upset.Hah!

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,020
Chaewon and Minju - Tommy's hair is pretty!
(Suddenly?Haha

Tommy. - Oh, really? They say your hair is pretty. Thank you.Haha
Eugene. - What is it?lol

43
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,080
Minju - Doesn't it suit you so well? Everyone? I think short hair suits you well.
Tommy. - And I got my hair bobbed hair.
44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,180
Chaewon - (I agree) Yes.
Tommy. - Really?

Minju. - Yeah, you look great.
Chaewon - It's totally new.

46
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,789
Tommy - But which one would be better? Long hair?
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,146
Eunbi - I have short hair.

48
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:18,240
Eunbi - Because it's new
Minju - It's been a while for me too.
Eugene. - That's right.

51
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,580
Tommy - Uh-huh.
Yujin - It looks good on you, too.

52
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,444
Yujin - You have to do it for a long time when you reveal it. Or else you'll be sorry.
Chaewon - (Eunbi) Unnie's headrest

53
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,094
Eugene - You're gonna be so sorry. Probably.
Minju - That's perfect.

54
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:33,160

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,760
- You?
Yujin - But you~
Tommy - I like your bobbed hair.

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,940
Yujin - I have long hair and short hair very often.
Minju. - That's right.

57
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,785
Eunbi - I've grown a lot.
Chaewon - All, they both do it often.
Minju - You look good together, but I personally think you look good.

58
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:45,000
I like short hair.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,960
Minju - Complete Personal Taste
Chae Won - Different Feelings Completely Different
What's that reaction?

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,460
- I'm worried.

61
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,660
I love your short hair.

62
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:57,900

Yujin - Really?

65
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:08,420
Minju - Eugene's perfect for a stop.

66
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,165
Chaewon - Perfect!
Tommy, and I like it when I don't have bangs.

67
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:17,620
Minju - By the way, it's been a while since I've seen my bangs????
Eugene. - Right.
Eunbi. - Yeah, it feels different.

68
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,820
I have a good time getting off.

69
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,515
Minju - I like the bangs. You don't like it?
- None of them.

70
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:26,240
Minju - lol. I'much.

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,560
No, but when I first got off, I thought you were really pretty.

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,820
CHAE WON - That's right.
Minju - But I feel empty without bangs.

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,940
Eugene. - Really? I'm so happy I'm not here.
Minju - No, I feel a little empty these days.

Minju. - That's good.
Yujin - Don't you feel comfortable?

75
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,990
Minju. - I love it. But
I'm so comfortable on stage.
Tommy. - It's really comfortable.

76
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,755
CHAE WON - Without bangs, I'm jealous of the fact that I can flip it over on stage.
- That's right.

77
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:46,420
Minju - That little baby head is a bit of a poke in the eye.

78
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,405
- That's hard. I'm a government official. I'm curly.

79
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:52,420
- My bangs aren't as pretty as Chaewon.

80
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:55,720
Chaewon - (Comments) It looks like Chaewon's wig.
- Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.

81

Tommy. - He's cute.
CHAE WON - It looks like a real ruler, right?
Eugene. - Totally straight.

83
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:12,000
Minju. - You've changed your hairstyle, not everyone knows.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,375
Eunbi - Oh, right. It was.
Eugene. - That's right.

85
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,135
Eugene. - Totally. Who else?

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,835
Again...

00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,640
Chaewon - (Comments) Everything is pretty.

94
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,180
Minju - Tommy, you look so purple on the screen.

95
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,760
- If you look at it like this, it looks like light purple, right?
Tommy. - That's right.

96
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,020
Tommy. - And Hitomi's all grown up. To get here,

CHAE WON - Hey, this is how time went by.
Minju. - I know.

102
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,940
Minju - I can't wait to grow them.
Tommy. - That's how much I've had. Like Eunbi unni right now?
Eugene. - Right.

103
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Tommy. - But it grew all the way here.
CHAE WON - Wow, you've grown a lot.

104
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,060
Eunbi - You've grown, haven't you?
Minju - You've really grown up.

105
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,300
Eunbi - It looks like you've grown a little bit, right?

106
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,340
Chaewon - Grow up.

107
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,220
Tommy. - I used to spray a lot back then.

108
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,860
Tommy. - You, too. You, too, right?
Eunbi - Yeah, spray.
Minju. - You can't see it.
CHAE WON - Press it like this

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,900
Eunbi. - Spray it.
Minju - That's uncomfortable.

110
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,080
Minju - When will my hair grow?
Eunbi - It's short to tie your hair.

111
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Tommy. - Minju keeps on going.

112
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Minju - Why do I feel the same hair for a year?
Chaewon - Why isn't your hair growing?

113
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,880
Minju - It's not growing. Let me grow up.Haha

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,200
Chaewon - What's wrong with your back hair?
MIN JU - What's wrong with your back hair?
Eunbi - It's short.

115
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:53,145
Minju-Chaewon, why do you always wear the same t-shirt?

119
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:04,740
Minju - Oh! You know, like this. You have seaweed on your face. Handsome.

120
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,300
Chaewon - Hey, that's too obvious.
Yujin - When did you do that?

121
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,540
Eunbi - I didn't know.
Minju. - Isn't it like this?
You know that pretty is a bit old, right?

122
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,840
Chaewon - Pretty is old, WIZ*ONE is disappointed!
Minju - Oh really? Oh, I like this kind of stuff.

123
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,493
YU JIN - Did WIZ*ONE do this? It was totally new.

125
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,210
Chaewon - Nonsense?
Eugene - Shouldn't there be someone who's asking questions?

126
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,505
Minju - What if the king falls?
127
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:31,260
Yujin - King Kong!
Eunbi - Oh, you're good. I need to pay.

128
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,840
- Do you want me to try?

129
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
Chaewon - Can you give it to me?

130
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,180
I'm searching for a nonsense quiz.

131
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,020
Eunbi - Should I make it easier?
Minju. - Yeah.
Chaewon - But I can see everything.

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,665
Eunbi - Funny nonsense

133
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,915

140
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,400
Minju - (Explaining to Tommy hard...)
Eunbi - I don't think this is right. I don't think I can get it right.

141
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,180
Eugene. - No way?

142
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,080
Chaewon - Is that a whimper?

143
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,880
Yujin - What if I cry? Oh, what the hell?

144
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,320
Minju - (To Tommy) I'll let you know later.
Tommy - haha.
Eunbi - Should I not say no?

145
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Eugene - I'm curious. But, wait a minute.

146
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,780
Minju. - Look at her and... (Something easy)
Eunbi - Oh, okay. (Found it) Do you want to do it?

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,180
Eunbi - What car do middle and high school students ride?

148
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:36,453
Minju - Used Car

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,780
Eunbi - Oh~~
Chaewon - Oh, this was easy (?)

150
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,560
Minju - ?? Hey!Haha
Yujin - I'm not impressed.

151
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,720
Eugene - Nonsense should be a little touching.
Eunbi - Okay!

152
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,660
Eunbi - What does your servant say when he breaks up with the king?

153
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,520
Eugene - Viking!

154
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:57,649
Tommy. - Viking?

155
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,935
Eugene - bye, king. King
Tommy. Oh.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Eunbi - Which floor is higher than the floor?

157
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,780
- A floor higher than the floor?

158
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,440
Tommy - The soles. Huh? Is that right?
Eunbi - Wow! Right.

159
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:16,284
Minju - Wow, how do you get it right?
CHAE WON - Wow, I'm really bad at guessing.

160
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:18,919
Yujin - More than a father, oh! This~?
Eunbi - That's amazing.

161
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,735
Yujin - You're smart.
Eunbi - I'll go easy now.

162
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,773
Eunbi - There's a good chance we won't get this right.

163
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:26,356
- What if the park gets old?

164
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,000
Minju - Is the park getting old?

165
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,380
Eunbi - I don't think I can get this right.
Eugene - I-Park...

166
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,460
Eunbi - Huh? It's similar.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,620
Eugene - Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I-Park Mall?

168
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,700
- Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.
Yujin - What's there?

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,505
Eugene. - Adult. Adult...

170
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:48,285
Minju - The ball is getting old.
Eugene - Park... A fight?

171
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,240
Minju - One... One two?

172
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,500
Eugene - I-Park... It's similar to I-Park?

173
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,045
Minju - I don't understand.
Eunbi - Park again...

174
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,200
Eugene - Adult Park? A 20-year-old park?
Eunbi - I don't think I can get this right. It’s too difficult. (Correct answer) Thudsak.

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,505
Minju. - Well... What? You're old.

176
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,260
Eunbi - What land is it with people who do everything roughly?

177
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Minju - Do everything roughly?
Tommy, Eugene. - Land?

178
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:19,520
- Everything

179
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,065
Eunbi - You're all watching right now, were I looking at my cell phone alone?

180
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:23,973
- No, no, no?

181
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,320
- All...

182
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,800
- Horses... all of them?

183
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,380
Chaewon, Minju - All? You're not doing anything?

184
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,140
Eunbi - a land of people who do everything roughly.

185
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,720
Yujin - A hint.
Eunbi - A hint?

186
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,380
Eunbi - Oreung O land.
CHAE WON - Idiot!

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,865
Eunbi - Uh... Right.

188
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:46,370
Yujin - Didn't you give them all? That's enough? Oh, no, no, no, no.

189
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,560
Minju - Your sense is difficult.
Eunbi. - Then?

190
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,060
Eunbi - What if I say no doorbell in two letters?

191
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:56,280
- Nobel...

192
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,740
Eunbi - Oh, yeah.

193
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,880
Yujin - Really? I think I'm a genius.
Minju - You're a genius. You have a real sense.

194
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:06,675
Eugene - Nonsense Genius
Chaewon - Why can't I get any right?

195
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,920
Minju - It's hard for me, too.

196
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,140
Eunbi - What bus do art students take?

197
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,460
Minju - Art major?
Eugene - Canvas?

198
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:16,353
Eunbi - Oh, right.

199
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
- Wow
Eunbi - You're good.

200
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,620
EUN BI - WON YOUNG and YU JIN are so good.
Minju - You have a real sense.
YU JIN - Yeah, WON YOUNG is really good.

201
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,300
Eunbi - I'm really bad at this.

202
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,051
Chaewon - That's awesome.

203
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,400
Minju. - It's hard.

204
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,100
Eunbi - Did WIZ*ONE get all the answers right?
Minju - WIZ*ONE didn't get it right, did they?

205
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,480
Yoojin - Canvas, huh? I got the canvas right.
Tommy. Oh.

206
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,240
Chaewon - Oh, this is slow.
Eunbi - What's the Tayo bus?

207
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,720
Yujin - Out!

208
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:44,360
- Ahn Yu-jin, genius

209
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,080
Minju - Yujin is a genius.
Yujin - I saw you~

210
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,440
Eugene - You have a good sense.
Chaewon - I think she's stuck here.

211
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,440
Yujin - Chaewon looks like a middle school student.Haha

212
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,360
Minju - You don't look like a middle school student. You look like a kindergarten student.Haha

213
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,920
CHAE WON - Hey, not kindergarten.
Eugene - 12 years old. twelve years old

214
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,460
Eunbi - Shark half Chaewon is the same. Shark half Chaewon is the same.

215
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,060
Minju - She's like a real kindergarten student.
Yujin - 12 years old~

216
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,420
Chaewon - Don't make fun of me.
EUN BI - Oh, right. WIZ*ONE got an award today. Did you see it?

217
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,500
Tommy. Yes, that's right. Thank you.
- Thank you. - Thank you. WIZ*ONE~

218
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,920
Eunbi - WIZ*ONE gave us an award.
Eugene. - That's right.

219
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,600
Eugene - We're coming back then.

220
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,660
When I won the Rookie of the Year award, I was just walking...
Minju. - That'sir.

221
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,515
Chaewon - I felt so awkward walking back then.
Eugene. Yeah, I remembered the time I was walking.

222
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:33,430
Minju - I didn't even go on a lot of promotions.

223
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:36,400
- I remember being so nervous about the timing. today
Eugene. - Right.

224
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:40,900
Eunbi. - We walked like this. We walked like this.
Minju. - That's right. Right. Memorize the timing.

225
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,900
- That Danve, nervous, that silhouette.

226
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,920
Minju - It's like yesterday.
Eugene. - That's when I just remembered.
CHAE WON - I don't think it's been that long.

227
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,540
Minju - Not the day before yesterday.

228
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Not the day before yesterday.
LOL

229
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,120
Minju - I'm sorry.I've gone overboard.
Eugene. - Three years ago? Two years ago...

230
00:11:58,212 --> 00:11:59,114
Minju. - How do you feel?

231
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,480
Eugene. - How long ago?
Minju - As long as you feel... 1 year

232
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,580
Minju - Don't you think that's enough?
- Uh, that's about it.

233
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,580
Eunbi - O... You're right.

234
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,850
Eunbi - I just think I was nervous about the first award ceremony we had since our debut.

235
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,960
It was. It was perfect.
Eunbi - I think I was really nervous.

236
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,765
Chaewon - I was really nervous.
Eunbi - I'm still nervous, but I was so nervous back then.

237
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:30,460
Minju - Every word made me really shudder.
238
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,860
Eugene - I'm just...

239
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,920
- When we said our acceptance speech when we debuted,
You and Wonyoung used to do a lot of things.

240
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,290
- I didn't know. So I just said, "Wow, I got an award. I love it.That's about it.

241
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,140
- You sometimes say things, right?

242
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,980
- I'm so nervous.
Chaewon and Minju. - They said they were really nervous today.

243
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:54,084
Eugene - Yeah, yeah.
Tommy. - Good job.

244
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:58,055
I was so nervous at the time of your death.
Minju. - Oh, that's right.

245
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,620
Minju - I think I'm really nervous.
Yujin - I always laughed next to you when you made a mistake. There was a reason why you made a mistake.

246
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:09,540
Eunbi - I have it.
Chaewon - Menba Menba
Minju - But isn't it really nerve-wracking to think of it as a live show?

247
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,780
MIN JU - I don't remember what to say all of a sudden because of the idea that it's going out in real time.

248
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,480
Eunbi - That's true, but the person in front of me does it, and then I try to do it.

249
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,640
I can't remember when I was listening to someone in front of me.

250
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,400
Eunbi - What I was trying to say is...
Tommy. - Yeah, on a slow trip.

251
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,120
YU JIN - Oh, right!

252
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,480
Eugene - So, oh, my gosh. I was like, "What should I do?"

253
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,300
Chaewon - This is going all at once. Once you get it wrong, you have to go again.
- That's right, that's right.

254
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,270
Chaewon - So it was a little bit (difficult)

255
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,505
Yujin - That's exactly why you're wrong.
Tommy. - That'sir.

256
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:44,039
Yujin - So what do I do? x2 But my microphone was ticking.
Tommy. - He's not coming out.

257
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:47,600
Tommy. - Thank God.
Eugene - That's why I'm doing it again.

258
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,720
Eugene - I'm glad to hear that.LOL

259
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,400
- As soon as you're done.
260
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,320
Eugene - I didn't think we'd get the right timing.

261
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,080
Minju. - That's right.
Eugene. - I knew it wouldn't work.

262
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:04,295
Eunbi - I think we've improved a lot.
Timing it out.

263
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:07,500
Yujin - Touching? Touching talk?
Minju. - That's right. It's been a while since I've talked to you.

264
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:13,755
Eunbi - I'm talking with Yujin and Wonyoung today, and they're so good. You've improved a lot. I was proud of it.

265
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:16,160
Yujin - You should look at me and talk to talk to me.

266
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,095
- I'm talking about me.

267
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:20,452
Minju - You've been singing since this morning.

268
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,170
Minju. - I'm glad to hear that. older sister
CHAE WON - Oh, you were so pretty.

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,235
Eugene - My hands are sweating.

270
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,400
Minju. - Why? Were you nervous?
Yujin - Nervous, nervous talk and now lol

271
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,935
Eunbi - We were talking about touching things.

272
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:37,466
CHAE WON - Oh, that's right. We had LASIK.
Eunbi. - That's right.

273
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,530
Eunbi - We were supposed to do it on the same day, but I did it first.

274
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:46,305
Minju - I envy you. I've been thinking about it. I need to think about it a little bit more.

275
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:48,275
I'm a little scared.

276
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,640
(Tommy's small hand size) Awesome.

277
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,980
Minju - There's no real lens marks.

278
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,165
I'm still wearing transparent lenses.
Eunbi - I was going to lie down with you on the same day.

279
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,040
Eunbi - I just did it first.

280
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:02,365
Chaewon - He's in a hurry.
Eugene. - Why did you do that?

281
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,930
Eunbi - I was in a hurry and had a hard time wearing glasses, so I did it first, and I told Chaewon about the review.

282
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,860
Minju - No~
Tommy - You can't wear colored lenses anymore?
283
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:12,025
Eunbi - Wouldn't it be better not to wear them anymore?

284
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:17,610
Minju - No, I came home that day, and Chaewon was standing there wearing pink sunglasses.

285
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
So, I laughed a lot. What are you talking about?

286
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,420
But she took off her sunglasses and showed them to you. Is she recovering faster than you thought?

287
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:29,760
CHAE WON - Are you saying you don't have to wear sunglasses?

288
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,990
Oh~
Chaewon - I used to wear sunglasses.lol

289
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,455
Yujin - How long did you wear it? One day?
Chaewon - About a day?

290
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,645
Minju - She was standing up there, and it was so funny.

291
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:41,979
Chaewon - I don't need to wear sunglasses.
Eunbi - I think there's dust in my eyes.

292
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Yujin - Uhm? No, I'm not.

293
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,775
No? Ah!

294
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,102
No, I'm not.

295
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,020
Chaewon - Wow, your eyelashes are really long.
Eunbi - No, I think it's there.

296
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,420
CHAE WON - Nothing.

297
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Eugene. - Nothing.
Eunbi - I felt it.

298
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,220
Tommy. - Wait, no, no, this way. x2

Chaewon - Hey, can you see that?

302
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,920
Eunbi - Wow...
I can't see it.

303
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:17,795
EUN BI - Yeah, it's better without this.
You're right. Wow.

304
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:19,612
Minju - It's bigger than I thought.
Eugene - I mean,

305
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,930
Yujin - I guess you couldn't see it because it was thin.
306
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,140
Yujin - Solved~

307
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,520

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,275
Eugene - I'm probably... Even in 2022

317
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:59,505
- And I think, 'Oh, it's already 2022?'
- Right. - I think so.

318
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,835
Yujin - I think it's been a year since we talked about this.
Eunbi - Oh, time flies so fast.

319
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:09,350
Minju - I think it was just yesterday that we turned on the Christmas tree and counted down.
Yujin - Oh, that's right~ That's right. x2

320
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,340
Eugene. - I did, but...
Eunbi - Time flies so fast.

321
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:17,165
Minju - You can't reach the light. Come here.
Yujin - That's right. It's hard, right?

322
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:18,520
Chaewon - I'm having a hard time.lol

323
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,950
Yujin - Switch seats?
Chaewon - But can't you see it here?

324
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,160
Yujin - I can see it. Instead, it's a little dark.
Minju. - I can see it.
Chaewon - It's okay! V

325
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,070
Minju - But, it comes in a similar color to the sofa.lol

326
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,523
You look like a different V LIVE from us.
CHAE WON - No, it's okay. It's okay.
327
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,365
Minju - Oh, that's right. This cell phone looks dark because it's under the light.
Yujin - Oh, that's right.

328
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,400
Eugene - That's a good thing.

329
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:38,767
Eunbi - My hair grows really fast, right?

Eunbi - Doesn't it look like it's growing up?

332
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,820
Minju - But I grew up a lot, too.
Eunbi. - Yeah, it's been a long time.

333
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,420
Yujin - I think I need to put on my lips when I see this.
Hitomi - Oh, you're right.lol

334
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,980
- What do you think? - I need to put on my lips.
If you look at this, you don't have to put it.

335
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,040
Eugene - MLBB color feel...LOL

336
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,308

Yujin - Are you done?

342
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,560
Eunbi - I can only remember the delicious thing about it.
- That's right.

343
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,600
Minju - I really want to eat the meat I ate then.
Chaewon - I ate a lot back then.

344
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,000
Minju - And I remember that braised hairtail so much?

345
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,710
Eunbi - Um~
MIN JU - It was really good, right?

346
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,400
Yujin - But I'm really sorry to hear that.

00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:38,765
We always film before our comeback.
Oh, that's right!

Eugene. - Yeah. I was so sorry.
- That's right.

352
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:53,305
Minju - You're gonna take it out before you film it? I'll take it again and then I'll take it out.

353
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:55,360
Minju - I worked really hard on it. To make a comeback

354
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:58,830
Eunbi - On the first day, my face becomes like this, and on the second day, my face gets smaller.
Eugene. - Why?

355
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,540
Minju - First day, second day, third day.
And for the comeback kkk

356
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:11,155
Especially, if you eat salty food the day before, your face will be very noticeable.
Minju. - Oh, that's right.

357
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:15,800
Eugene - That's how it's always the second day of Ithing Trip.

YU JIN - It was really good.

360
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,260
Minju - Wasn't the window from the dorm so beautiful?
- Oh, that's right.

361
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,430
Minju. The window was circled, and it was the real ocean. It was like a real picture.
Eugene. - The accommodation was amazing.

362
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,530
Minju. There's a sea in that circle.
Yujin - You were so pretty.

363
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,655
Minju. It was my first time, and I think it was really pretty.

364
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:40,220
The night view is so beautiful.

365
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,145
Eugene. - Oh, yeah, we passed the intro.
Minju. - Yeah, I just moved on.

366
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,495
I really wanted to try something delicious in Jeonju.

367
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,060
- I didn't have time.
Minju - I didn't eat anything.

368
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,785
Yujin - We couldn't eat it and went to Yeosu. Isn't Jeonju famous for having so many delicious things?

369
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,200
Eunbi - Jeonju Hanok Village has lots of delicious food.

372
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:12,610

373
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:13,987
Chaewon - Oh really?

374

377
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:24,210
Yujin - Chocolate pie?

378
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,460
- No, I'm not. I'm really going to have chocolate.

379
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,030

380
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:31,435

381
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:34,425
Tommy. - Oh, really?
Eugene - Oh, of course, it was good.
Chaewon - Minju's taste.

382
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,020
Tommy. - You're democratized.
Minju - Let's go eat.

YU JIN - Yeah, it's good.
Minju - Oh, it's time to eat cheese balls. It's time to eat cheese balls.

385
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,650
Chaewon - Cheese ball! It's perfect right now.
Eunbi - I mean, I'm hungry right now.

386
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,920
Minju - I lost so much weight because I was in Seoul.

387
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,160
CHAE WON - Oh, it's really a cheese ball.

388
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,715
Yujin - I feel it right now.

389
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,815
Last time we finished our online concert, we sat here.
- That's right, that's right.

390
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,100
Yujin - Golden Olive.
Eunbi - The golden olives are so delicious.

391
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:10,280
Eugene. - You ate Boorinkle, too.

392
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:13,300
Minju - You know that potato chicken came out.
Tommy. - Oh, yeah.

393
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,055
Didn't you send it to me? I saw that and I knew it.
Minju - Isn't it crunchy O?

394
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,435
YU JIN - Crispy O.K.
Eunbi - I want to eat chicken.

395
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,429
Minju - It's time to eat chicken.

Chaewon - Cheese balls are perfect right now.

397
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,630
Tommy - I haven't tried that. Does it taste like chili peppers? -> It's spicy.
YU JIN - It's really good.

398
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,690
EUN BI - I love the chicken.
MIN JU - But strangely, it tastes the best when you eat with the members.

399
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,705
Minju - I ordered it last time when I was alone. I think it's the best when I eat with the members.

400
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:48,825
Yujin - Right. We have to eat chicken together.

401
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,110
Minju - Purao and Gubne pepper mayo are delicious when you eat it together.

402
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:57,070
Eunbi - You know what? Hoolala cheese buldak?

403
00:21:57,315 --> 00:22:01,280
MIN JU - I used to eat hula a lot when I was young. My dad...

404
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,700
Yujin - I've heard of it a lot. Have you seen a lot of Hoolala commercials?
Eunbi - That's really good.

405
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,975
Chaewon - I feel like I've heard a lot of things.
Did you hear a lot about her?

406
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:12,785
Yujin. - Whenever she asks me to eat chicken, I ask if I have a hula.
Minju - Is that roast chicken?

407
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:16,900
Eugene - We always say we're going to eat cheese balls, and I remember hearing that.
Minju - Cheese balls are delicious.

408
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,980
Tommy. - You liked your wife-in-law. once upon a time
Eugene. - Oh, that's right.
Tommy. - Now?

409
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:26,235
Eugene - Supreme... I like it.

410
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,355
Yujin - First of all, the members don't really like it.
Tommy. - Oh, yeah.

411
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:32,600
Eugene. - Even if I ask you to eat, you don't respond much.

412
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:35,135
Eugene. - Yeah.
Eunbi - I like it.
Minju - I like it, too.

413
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,455
Eugene. - But you prefer something else.
Eunbi - What do you like? Coke?

414
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:43,210
Yujin - No, no, no, don't you have a favorite chicken over Supreme? Everyone?

415
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:48,922
Whenever Minju asks me to eat Supreme, I say, "Let's eat cheese balls and Boorinkle."

416
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,177
YEJIN - YE NA especially wants to eat Boorinkle.
- That's right, that's right.

417
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:53,278
Minju - I'm actually the main cheeseball player.

418
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:57,170
Yujin - That's right. But I like all of them, so I like all of them.
Tommy - I like Honey. Honey
Minju - Oh, right. x2 It's delicious.

419
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,340
Eunbi - Do you like Honey? Tommy, do you like Honey?
Tommy. Yes.

420
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,985
Eunbi - I'm your honey~

421
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:06,340
Chaewon and Minju. - You should eat it with tteokbokki!

422
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:07,940
Yujin - That's right. That's a good idea.

423
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,563
Minju - No, because of Yujin, I really want to eat rose tteokbokki.

424
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:14,020
Eugene. - It's better again.
Eunbi - Yellow whole chicken x2

425
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:17,715
Eugene - That's what we had at the ballpark.

426
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,075
Eunbi - I remember eating it while filming the music video for Violeta.
Minju - That's a real chicken dump.

427
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:26,619
Tommy. - NAKO keeps doing this alone these days.
- Yellow chicken?!

428
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:29,430
Yujin - It's bigger than I thought.
Tommy - number two, number three.
Eunbi - They sell tteokbokki there, too.

429
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,470
Minju - Fried before it gets cold. It's so delicious.
Yujin - No, I...

430
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,180
YU JIN - What'sir?
Chae Won - Everything I eat on set is so delicious.

431
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:42,660
Minju - The last day of the shoot. I think the chicken I eat on the last day of the music video is the best.
Tommy. - Oh, I really felt like my stomach was about to explode.

432
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,355
Eunbi - That last shoot, the last day, it's really good, whatever you eat.

433
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:51,960
Eugene - No, I, uh, I was getting ready for our Fiesta, and I shot our first look.

434
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,420
I had blue hair. She was trying to lose weight.
435
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,815
Eugene. - We've got a kiln on set.
Tommy - Oh, yeah! I remember.

436
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:05,320
Yujin - I've never ordered chicken gangjeong like that, and I really wanted to eat it.

437
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,790
So every time I look at the Gamaro River, I think of you.

438
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:13,430
- I was really, really asking how I could get them to do this.
Eunbi - I ate it a lot when I was practicing.

439
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:20,925
Minju - I'm Cropple! In the practice room, it's a little...
Some members eat less.

440
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:27,455
- The members who don't get bloated easily.
I'm so jealous of the cruffle I ate while practicing in the practice room.

441
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,140
Yujin - Right. Waffle~ Okay.
Chaewon - This is really driving me crazy. the real thing
Minju - I really want to eat it.

442
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:37,370
Yujin - Watermelon juice. I've never seen anyone drink watermelon juice so well in winter.
Chaewon - Watermelon juice always in winter

443
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,900
CHAE WON - But it's really cold, so my head is spinning. During practice.

444
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,305
Eunbi - I had waffles yesterday and today.

445
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,270
Minju - Waffles are so delicious.

446
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:52,850
Eugene - Oh, that waffle, there's a waffle machine in the house.

447
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,695
So, I bought croissant's birthplace and she made a lot of them.

448
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,675
- He told me to come and eat this. So I kept eating it.

449
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:06,445
- I showed you. You bragged about it. It was really delicious.

450
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:10,310
And then you were satisfied, and you bought another croissant.

451
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,560
- I bought it at a different place this time.

452
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,990
I'm a little less moved than I was before.

453
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,680
Minju - We're going to have some bar rice cakes and stuff.
YU JIN - Right, we had bar rice cake. Dip it in honey.

454
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,630
Minju - Oh, I'm going to go.
Eugene - What?

455
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,270
Eunbi. - She pressed rice.
Yujin - That's right! Rice balls! Triangular kimbap and so on.

456
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,660
Tommy. - Is it good? (Imagine how it feels)

457
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,330
Tommy - like nurungji?
Yujin - It feels like you pressed "O"? Feels like fried rice.

458
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:36,750
Minju. There was grilled cheese.

459
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,815
Minju - I just imagined it. How about grilled cheese balls?

460
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,580
CHAE WON - WOW-WOO

461
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,180
Eunbi - It looks so delicious.
CHAE WON - But I really want to eat it now.

462
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:47,140
Minju - It looks so delicious.

463
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,135
Eunbi - I want to eat raw octopus.
Minju - Everyone, but it's time for late night snack.

464
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,820

465
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,050
Sunday. 11:27 p.m.
Chaewon - Tomorrow is Monday, everyone.

466
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,725
Chaewon - Fighting

467
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,595
Yujin - I want to eat it. I'd love to eat, honestly.

468
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,580
- I think she'll order it soon. in five minutes

469
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:11,410
Tommy. - Did you have dinner?
Minju - I had dinner. I ate a lot today.

470
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,990
Minju - I ate a lot today.LOL
Eugene - I really have something to do.

471
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,440
Minju - Aing~

472
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,540
Yujin - Minju was sitting next to me in the waiting room, and she said she was full.

473
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:25,155
Minju - I'm full, Yujin, I'm full, I'm full. Why am I so full?LOL
Eugene. - I've done it seven times.

474
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,185
- All day long, you said I was so full.

475
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,275
- I asked him at first. "What did you eat?"

476
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:34,205
Oh, he just ate tortillas and yogurt. But it's not a combination that's worth getting into.

477
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:38,565
Minju - I'm gonna have breakfast.
No! Don't make excuses! NO!
Tommy. - Please be quiet.

478
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:45,395
Minju - I had tortilla for one meal a day, and I wasn't going to eat yogurt because I was full, but tortilla was spicier than I thought.

479
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:50,280
- I tried to eat it to make my mouth water, but did you eat a lot while talking to Yuri?

480
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:56,345
I got in the car so full. Hyewon said, "Do you want to have a bite?'
That's what she's doing.

481
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,675
Wow, so I took a bite, and it was so delicious.

482
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:02,595
- So I arrived at the garage in that condition. I was so full.

483
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,540
Tommy, Eugene - So, uh...

484
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,045
MIN JU - Is Yujin next to you? So I'm full. I said, "I'm full." And Yujin said, "LOL."

485
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:13,700
She said, "Sister, stop being full."
Tommy, Eugene - (Makes 'yes' in the shape of a hand)

486
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,850
Minju. - I did.Haha

487
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,910
Eugene. - Really.
Minju. - Finish... That's ridiculous.

488
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,380
Eugene - He's a difficult man.

489
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,040
Chaewon, Minju - (Hamburger is delicious)
Yujin - That's right.

490
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,900
Yujin. - She ordered mac and cheese with me.

491
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,175
That's why I steal it. It's really salty, but it's so delicious.

492
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:37,505
Minju - It was the saltyest food I've ever had. It's the saltyest food I've ever eaten.

493
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,580
Eugene - The... It was really good.

Chaewon - I'm hungry.
Eunbi - Right?

495
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,960
Chaewon - I'm even more hungry talking about this.
Minju. - WIZ*ONE, you're hungry?

496
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,340
Eunbi - And didn't you eat a lot today?

497
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:52,900
Minju - Unexpectedly, I didn't eat much.Kkkkkkkkkkkkkk of old conscience
I didn't eat a lot.

498
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,255
Eunbi - I did eat pork belly.
Yujin - You don't eat a lot.
Democratic - (Rationalizing)

499
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:59,005
Chaewon, Tommy. - Right. She doesn't eat a lot.

500
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,160
Minju. - She's short-mouthed.
Chaewon - It's small.

501
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Minju - I'm upset.
Yujin - And she keeps leaving comments. I'm leaving a lot.

502
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,630
MIN JU - YE NA and I. Oh, it's the same for Chaewon.

503
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,380
Chaewon - I'm... Really?
Minju - I'm so full.

504
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,180
Minju - Oh, she was really hungry, but she said she'd be full if she took three bites.

505
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,160
Yujin - But you have big hands.

506
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,900
Eugene - That's why we end up eating everything we have left.

507
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,880
Eugene - I had to...

508
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:25,165
Eunbi - We ate together today. with Eugene
Chaewon - You can't leave anything behind.

00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:31,035
Eunbi - But I'm hungry. I think I can enjoy any chicken I order.

Yujin - The chicken you buy for me
Minju - (Promotion starts) Kwon Eunbi!

Eunbi - Raw octopus, raw fish, or chicken, cheese ball
Tommy. - I just had raw fish.

522
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,820
Minju - This is it. Do you take a hint of conscience for a late-night snack or just go heavy?
Eunbi - Right, right!

523
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:33,800
Minju - But I've been on a diet for a week for today.

526
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,270
Eugene - No, I'm not.
Minju - What do you want to eat?

527
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:47,725
Eugene - But I'm all... (I think it's good.)
Tommy. - Tell me what you want to eat.
Eugene. - Uh, I don't know.

528
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:50,925
Yujin - It's ambiguous. It's budae jjigae today. I'm haha.

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,745
There's a service where you can register your ethnic family account for delivery and ask for payment.

538
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:25,820
Yujin - Do you want to do it with me?
Eunbi - Are you doing this to your family?

00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:57,910
Eugene. - Yeah, I'm good at covering raw fish.

Minju - Oh, really?

581
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:43,505
Yujin - When it's the season, we eat figs in the fall, it's touching.

582
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,445
That's how I felt when I ate the defense.

583
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,075
Chaewon - Who eats skate?

584
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,520
Chaewon - I've tried skate once.

Chaewon - I tried skate once, it's not bad, but I don't want to eat it.

586

Minju, look forward to next week. Show show show show!

744
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:27,965

751
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,435

Minju - I'm really nervous. I mean, obviously, I think I memorized it.

753
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:58,260
But now that you have a camera, you can't do this at all.

754
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,015
Especially, the important thing is,
Eugene - Right. x2

755
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:04,505
Minju - But you think I can save this, so your eyes keep turning to promporters?

756
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:07,505

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,260
Minju - I can't do anything when I'm nervous.

Eugene - If you don't go in once,
That song won't go on.

904
00:51:39,635 --> 00:51:44,120
Eugene - If I could cook, I'd say,
I know what I put in.

905

Minju - Did you give it back? Where did he put it?
Tommy - It's fine when you're wearing it. - Eunbi. - When you're taking it out.

1133
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:20,066
Tommy - It hurts so much when you take it out.

1134
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,200
Eunbi - You need to pull your hand out here.
Tommy. - Yes, here.

1135
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,020
Eunbi - That's a little bit of a skill.
CHAE WON - Yeah, long nails can't take out the lenses.
Minju - I hate it so much.

1136
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,100
Chaewon - So I did LASIK!
Minju - I cut my nails here to get rid of the lens.

1137
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,400
Tommy - You cut your nails? - Minju. - Yeah, I got my nails cut.
I was so frustrated that I had my nails done, but I just cut them.

1138
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,080
Tommy. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Minju - I'm going to take off my lens.

1139
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,040
Minju - I'm not doing it for long. Again.

1140
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,020
Tommy - But is it okay if I keep growing it?

1141
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,135
Minju - So, you're the one who'
Your nails must be really strong.

1142
01:03:53,135 --> 01:03:55,040
Tommy - Thinning...
Chaewon - Give me a break. a break

1143
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,840
Eunbi - But when you rest, it's cut off.
It's getting too thin.

1144
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,395
Tommy. - Oh, really?
Eunbi - So I always say that.
So you need to apply a thin layer of transparency.

1145
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:05,240
Tommy - Oh... Is that right?
Yujin - Try it completely short.
Eunbi - I used to be really short.

1146
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,340
Eugene - Not at all! Not...I think we'll do that.
CHAE WON - Right, you were really short.
Eunbi - I couldn't grow my nails at all in the beginning.

1147
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,760
Yujin - Really? - Chaewon. - You were so short.
Totally short. / Minju. - Right, right, right.
Eunbi - I'm not out of flesh. My fingernails.

1148
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:15,560
Tommy. What? / Chaewon. - Yeah. It was really short.
Eunbi - I didn't grow my nails well.

1149
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,160
Yujin - Did you open it? Isn't that right?

1150
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,680
Eunbi - With your hands...
Eugene - Oh, yeah.

1151
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,500
Yujin - Like this
Eunbi - Bad Habits

1152
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,190
Oh~
Eunbi - I can't grow my toenails now.

1153
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,580
Yujin - How do you do your toenails? Why? Why?
Minju - It's very mini-mini-mini.
Chaewon - Wow, you're not sick?

1154
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:31,180
Yujin - Do you always cut it short?
Chaewon - How... - Minju - I think she's going to bleed.
Eunbi - I want to cut it like this.

1155
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,185
Eunbi - So, like this, out of the flesh.
If your toenails stick out like this,
Chaewon - It's too short. - Eugene. - It's uncomfortable.

1156
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:38,775
Minju - Doesn't it hurt too much if you cut it short?
I always leave this much behind.

1157
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:40,720
Eunbi - I've been like this since I was too young.

1158
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,200
Minju - Really? - Chaewon. - Really? You look sick.
Eunbi - But I want to grow this.

1159
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,045
So you went to get your nails done?
You want to get this, Teddy?

1160
01:04:46,045 --> 01:04:50,220
But it's too short.
He told me to grow it out.
Chaewon and Minju. - Really?
1161
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,700
Eunbi - Okay~

1162
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:58,320
Tommy. - When did you last rest?

1163
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:02,460
Eunbi - I never rested.
It's transparent, but when you rest,

1164
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:06,260
Eunbi - But I don't think I've been resting lately.
I think I kept doing it.
Eugene. - Oh, yeah.

1165
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:10,040
Minju. - Take a break. Concert.
Eunbi - It was a little short. I cut it this time.

1166
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:13,320
Tommy. - Yeah, I think so.
Eunbi - It's getting shorter, right?
Minju - You should get some rest. You have long nails.

1167
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:16,520
Chaewon - Really?
Minju. - I let it go.
Chaewon - Yeah.

1168
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,695
Eugene - If you go to Caribbean Bay or Ocean World,
Do you know what it is on the floor?

1169
01:05:20,695 --> 01:05:24,000
Eugene - Don't slip.
Minju - If you fall down there,
Do you know it's real?

1170
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,775
Eugene - Don't slip.
Chaewon - Anti-slip!

1171
01:05:25,775 --> 01:05:29,660
Eunbi - Listen to the sound.
Yujin - It's kind of like sand.
Minju. - That's right.

1172
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,540
Minju - Maybe it's because you're relaxed?

1173
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,190
Minju - My eyes are closing.

1174
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:39,433
Eunbi - Is that Yena's hat?

1175
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,980
Eunbi - That blue pink yellow thing?

1176
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,840
Minju - Is that right? Oh...
Eugene. - I think I used it before.

1177
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,680
Eunbi - Oh really? Surprising.

1178
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,225
Eugene. - Hip hop. What concept? When you take a scene,
Eunbi - Cotton candy hat. Cotton Candy Hat

1179
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:52,306
CHAE WON - That's amazing. I think it's really unique.

1180
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,760
Eugene - I'm actually...

1181
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,745

Yujin - Thank you for your hard work.
